Loan Approval Prediction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict loan approval statuses. Using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, The final predictions were submitted to Kaggle for evaluation.

Project Overview
Loan approval prediction is a classification problem that predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant information. This project includes:

Data preprocessing
Feature engineering
Model training and selection
Prediction generation and submission

Dataset
The dataset consists of two files:

train.csv: Used to train and validate the model.
test.csv: Used for generating final predictions for submission.
Each row in the dataset represents a unique loan application, with features related to the applicant's demographic, financial details, and loan history.

Project Workflow
Data Import:

Imported the training and test datasets into the environment.
Data Cleaning:

Checked for null values in both datasets and handled them appropriately (e.g., filling or dropping based on feature importance).
Feature Engineering:

Applied Label Encoding to 4 categorical columns to convert them into numerical format.
Dropped unnecessary columns that did not contribute to the predictive model.

Model Selection:

Tried different machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM) and compared their scores.
Used GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters and find the optimal settings for each model.
Final Model:

Selected Random Forest as the final model based on its performance.

Trained the Random Forest model on the entire training dataset.
Prediction:

Generated predictions on the test.csv dataset.
Combined the predictions with the ID column from the test set to create the final submission dataset.
Submission:

Submitted the final dataset to Kaggle competitions for evaluation.
Installation
To run this project, install the following libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

Usage
Clone this repository.
Import train.csv and test.csv datasets.
Run the notebook or Python script to execute the workflow.
The final predictions will be saved in a CSV file, ready for Kaggle submission.

Results
The Random Forest model performed best with an accuracy of [91]% on the validation data. The model showed promising results, especially after hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to loan approval prediction. By preprocessing the data, selecting appropriate features, and tuning a Random Forest model. Further improvements could include feature engineering and testing additional ensemble methods for better performance.
